## Project Overview

This project is used to demonstrate penetration testing for various common vulnerabilities found in web applications. The focus is on identifying, exploiting, and mitigating security flaws to improve overall system security.

### 3. Penetration Testing Overview

- **SQL Injection**: Critical vulnerabilities related to SQL queries allowing unauthorized data access. *(Risk level: 7)*  
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injection attacks enabling the execution of malicious scripts in a web browser. *(Risk level: 8)*  
- **Broken Authentication**: Flaws in user authentication mechanisms leading to unauthorized access. *(Risk level: 10)*  
- **Cryptographic Failures (Sensitive Data Exposure)**: Insecure data handling practices, exposing sensitive information. *(Risk level: 12)*  
- **Broken Access Control (Elevation of Privilege)**: Issues allowing users to gain higher access permissions than intended. *(Risk level: 13)*  
- **Security Misconfiguration**: Improperly configured security settings leading to potential vulnerabilities. *(Risk level: 15)*
